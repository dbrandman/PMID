# PMID Fetcher

If you're like me, you probably spend a lot of time finding references on pubmed, but don't have an easy way to import the references into your `.bib` bibliography. 

Here's a command-line tool, based on (this link)[http://www.genomearchitecture.com/2014/06/how-to-convert-pubmed-references-to-bibtex] that solves this problem.

## Dependencies:
`xsltproc`

## Usage:
`PMID 30216140`
